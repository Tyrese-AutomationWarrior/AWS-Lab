I have updated the demo code for the AWS architecture 2 to support new technologies and simplify the setup process. The original code can be found at [https://github.com/thejungwon/AWS/](https://github.com/thejungwon/AWS/tree/master/architecture2).


> **Note**
> You must have AWS account so you can create all services required and remember to understand AWS services before using this script, create account at https://aws.amazon.com/free/ Good Luck!!


# Added supports 
- python3
- boto3
- refactored and remove unnecessary code

# AWS Services
- EC2
- RDS
- S3

# Prerequisites

- EC2-server with ports firewall allowed to be accessed.
- S3 bucket with security policies allowed to be accessed, get S3 REGION 
- RDS database created to get username, password, and database name and rds endpoint
- allow inbound traffic in RDS so RDS endpoint can be accessed
- security credentials for accessing aws services, including ACCESS_KEY AND SECRET_KEY

my s3 bucket policy configuration, modify to meet your needs
